    <h1>11/29/2024 - Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first blog post. That's all there is to say about this. <br> <br> That is, <i>about this.</i> There's stil a lot <i>to say.</i> <br> Anyway, what now? I mean I have nothing else to show on this site, so might as well start a blog for fun. I have no goal with this, so whatever pos into my head is going through the keys and in here. <br> First off, let's talk about the guy behind the screen. Me. I like programming, ThinkPads, Linux, history, the list goes on. I have <a href="https://www.cookingwebsite.html-5.me">another website</a> that I'm working on for TSA (Technology Student Association). <br> Enough about me. Let's talk about this site. It's to share my creations via downloads and well, blogging. I want to add an RSS feed to this blog, but can't figure out exactly how. <br> I've decided to name this blog AoT, or Autism of Things. I came up with this because this blog will be about many different things, some with alomst no connection whatsoever, and instead of being connected by the Internet, as in IoT(Internet of Things), they'll be connected with my autism.<br> Anywho, that's all. <i>Bye!</i></p>
