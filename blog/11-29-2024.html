    <h1>11/29/2024 - Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first blog post. That's all there is to say about this. <br> <br> That is, <i>about this.</i> There's stil a lot <i>to say.</i> <br> Anyway, what now? I mean I have nothing else to show on this site, so might as well start a blog for fun. I have no goal with this, so whatever pos into my head is going through the keys and in here. <br> First off, let's talk about the guy behind the screen. Me. I like programming, ThinkPads, Linux, history, the list goes on. I have <a href="https://www.cookingwebsite.html-5.me">another website</a> that I'm working on for TSA (Technology Student Association). <br> Enough about me. Let's talk about this site. It's to share my creations via downloads and well, blogging. I want to add an RSS feed to this blog, but can't figure out exactly how. <br> Anywho, that's all. <i>Bye!</i></p>
