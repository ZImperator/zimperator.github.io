    <h1>Linux: How to make it mainstream</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! This was originally intended to be release yesterday, but I was busy. I'll try to post every Saturday from now on. <br> <br> <br> Anyway, let's get started. As I said previously, I use Linux as a hobby. Currently, Linux has only about 4% market share, with Windows having about 70%(source: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide">Statcounter</a>). However, more and more software is being made compatible with Linux, as it is growing in popularity. </p>
